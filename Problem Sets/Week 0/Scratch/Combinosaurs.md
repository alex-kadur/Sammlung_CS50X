# COMBINOSAURS

---

"COBINOSAURS" is a dinosaur-themed pattern guessing/finding game.

You will see a title screen first and can either start the game by clicking "START" or see instructions by clicking "i". The "X" button in the upper right corner always leads back to the title screen. After selecting "START" the user sees a matrix of 3 x 4 yellow buttons on the left half of the screen. These buttons turn red if clicked. There is also an indicator showing the total number of red buttons and indicators for the number of red buttons per row/column. The goal of the game is to select the correct (random) pattern and click "CONFIRM". If the pattern was indeed correct, the flying dinosaur on the right half of the screen  will scream "CORRECT!". If wrong, it will scream "WRONG!". The flying dinosaur also acts as a timer. The green dinosaur will help by giving information on one random wrong button per unsuccessful attempt. It will also tell the total number of attempts needed at the end of the game. The "CONFIRM" button will turn into "AGAIN" if the correct pattern has been confirmed. Clicking "AGAIN" will start a new round with a new random pattern.
